## Unprotected SELFDESTRUCT Instruction

### Description
Malicious parties can exploit missing or insufficient access controls to trigger the self-destruct function of the contract.

### Remediation
It is advisable to remove the self-destruct functionality unless it serves a critical purpose. If there is a legitimate use case, it is highly recommended to implement a multisignature scheme, requiring approval from multiple parties, to execute the self-destruct action securely.
