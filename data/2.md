## Code With No Effects

### Description:
In the Solidity programming language, it is possible to write code that does not achieve the intended outcomes. Presently, the Solidity compiler does not issue warnings for such ineffectual code. Consequently, this can result in the inclusion of "dead" code that fails to execute the desired actions.

For example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)("");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-104).

### Remediation:
It is crucial to meticulously ensure that your contract functions as expected. Writing unit tests to confirm the correct behavior of the code is strongly recommended.
