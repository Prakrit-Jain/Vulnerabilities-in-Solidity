## Message Call with Explicit Gas Amount

### Description:
The functions `transfer()` and `send()` have traditionally forwarded a hardcoded gas amount of 2300. This practice was often recommended to protect against reentrancy attacks. However, it's important to note that the gas costs of EVM instructions can change significantly during hard forks, potentially causing issues for deployed contract systems that rely on fixed gas assumptions. For instance, [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) disrupted several existing smart contracts due to increased gas costs associated with the SLOAD instruction.

### Remediation:
To mitigate this issue, refrain from using `transfer()` and `send()` with hardcoded gas amounts. Instead, utilize the `.call.value(...)("")` method. Additionally, adopt the checks-effects-interactions pattern and implement reentrancy locks to safeguard against reentrancy attacks.
