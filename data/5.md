## Floating Pragma

### Description
When deploying contracts, it is crucial to use a specific compiler version and flags that have been thoroughly tested. Failing to do so might lead to unintended issues caused by using an outdated or incompatible compiler version. Therefore, it is recommended to lock the Solidity pragma version in your contracts to ensure compatibility and stability.

### Remediation
To address this concern, always specify the exact Solidity compiler version in your contract pragma statement. Additionally, take into consideration any known bugs associated with the chosen compiler version by referring to the [Solidity release notes](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases).

Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally.
