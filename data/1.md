## Re-entrancy:

### Description:
One of the key features of Ethereum smart contracts includes the ability to call and use the code of other external contracts. The contract also typically holds ether and therefore often sends ether to various external addresses. Calling an external contract or sending ether to an address requires the contract to submit an external call. These external calls can be hijacked by an attacker and force the contract to execute additional code (i.e. mainly using a fallback function), including the callback itself. Thus the code execution "re-enters" the contract.

Basically in the reentrancy attack, a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.

### Remediation:
The best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:

1. Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)
2. Use a reentrancy lock (ie.  [OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol)).
