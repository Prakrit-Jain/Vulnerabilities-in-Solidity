## Unencrypted Private Data On-Chain

### Description:
The belief that private type variables cannot be accessed is a common misconception. Even if your contract is not publicly visible, malicious actors can inspect contract transactions to deduce the values stored in the contract's state. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid storing unencrypted private data in the contract's code or state.

### Remediation:
Any private data should either be stored off-chain, or carefully encrypted.
