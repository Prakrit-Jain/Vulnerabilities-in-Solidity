## DoS with Failed Call

### Description:
External calls, whether accidental or deliberate, can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition within a contract. To mitigate the impact of such failures, it is advisable to segregate each external call into its own transaction, which can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This approach is particularly relevant for payments, where allowing users to withdraw funds rather than automatically pushing funds to them not only minimizes the risk of gas limit-related issues but also enhances security.

### Remediation:
To prevent DoS attacks with failed calls, consider the following best practices:

1. Avoid consolidating multiple calls within a single transaction, especially when calls are executed within loops.
2. Always assume that external calls can fail
3. Implement the contract logic to handle failed calls
