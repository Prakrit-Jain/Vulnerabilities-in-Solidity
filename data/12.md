## Price Oracle Manipulation 

### Description

In decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, smart contracts often rely on price oracles to determine the value of assets like Ethereum (ETH). These oracles fetch price data from various sources, such as Uniswap pools, to establish the asset's current value within the system. However, this setup can be exploited by attackers who employ flash loans to manipulate the price and gain an advantage within the ecosystem.

The attack unfolds in the following way: An attacker initiates a flash loan to substantially drain one side of a Uniswap pool. Since the system relies heavily on this single data source, the internal price of the asset is directly affected and manipulated, often inflated to an extreme value, such as 100 times its actual worth. Once this manipulation occurs, the attacker can capitalize on the skewed price. This could involve executing profitable arbitrage trades or taking advantageous positions within the DeFi system to maximize gains.

The issues with this scenario are twofold:

1. The overreliance on a single price feed source within the smart contract makes it susceptible to on-chain manipulation through flash loans.
2. Despite the glaring anomaly in price data, the smart contracts that depend on this information continue to function based on the manipulated data, potentially resulting in financial imbalances within the DeFi ecosystem.
