## Uninitialized Storage Pointer

### Description:
Uninitialized local storage variables can inadvertently reference unexpected storage locations within the contract, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities, whether intentional or unintentional.

### Remediation:
Before using storage variables, assess whether the contract genuinely requires a storage object, as this might not be necessary in many cases. If a local variable sufficient, explicitly mark its storage location with the `memory` attribute. In situations where a storage variable is indeed needed, ensure it is initialized upon declaration and explicitly specify the storage location as `storage`.
