## Unchecked Call Return Value

### Description
When making a message call to another contract, it is essential to verify the return value of that call. Failing to do so can result in issues where the execution continues even if the called contract throws an exception. If the call fails accidentally or an attacker forces the call to fail, this may lead to unexpected behavior in the subsequent program logic.

### Remediation
To mitigate this risk, if you choose to use low-level call methods, always include logic to check the return value of the call. This ensures that your contract handles the possibility of a failed call appropriately.
