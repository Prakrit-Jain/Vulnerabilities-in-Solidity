## State Variable Default Visibility

### Description:
Clearly specifying the visibility of state variables helps prevent misunderstandings regarding their accessibility and also contributes to writing gas-optimized code.

### Remediation:
State variables should be categorized as `public`, `internal`, or `private`. It is important to explicitly define the visibility for all state variables.
