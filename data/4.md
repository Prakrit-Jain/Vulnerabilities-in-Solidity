## Arithmetic Over/Under Flows

### Description:
An overflow or underflow in computer programming refers to a situation where an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or falls below the minimum value that can be represented by a specific data type. To illustrate, if we store a number in a uint8 type, it implies that the number is held within an 8-bit unsigned integer, capable of representing values ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In the realm of programming, an integer overflow takes place when an arithmetic operation tries to produce a numeric value that lies beyond the range representable by the allocated number of bits â€“ exceeding the maximum or going below the minimum valid value.

`2^256+1 = 0`

`0-1 = 2^256`

### Remediation:

To address this concern, it is advisable to consistently employ well-established and safe mathematical libraries for performing arithmetic operations across the entire smart contract system.
